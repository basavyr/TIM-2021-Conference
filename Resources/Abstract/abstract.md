# TIM 2021 Abstract
## A Novel Approach for the Semi-Classical Description of the Wobbling Properties in Odd-$A$ Nuclei

## Core ideas

- importance of triaxial nuclei in nuclear physics
- difficulty in identifying the triaxial signatures experimentally
- new features of the current approach:
  - parity partner bands in $^{163}$Lu
