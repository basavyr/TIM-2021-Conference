# Presentation structure

Based on the abstract, the presentation should have the following structure.

* define the triaxiality in nuclei
	* nuclear shape is defined in terms of the deformation parameters
	* nuclear moments of inertia define the asymmetry between the three principal axis of the triaxial nucleus
* give insight on the prolate vs. oblate shapes in terms of the **quadrupole moment**
